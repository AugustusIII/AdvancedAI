The contents of the two games have been categorized in two separate folders.

Each folder contains a "sarsa.py" file. While this wasn't used in the results of the paper, you may inspect it to see our implementation. The "pg.py" file contains the agents which were used in oder to obtain the results. It can also be executed to observe the online performance of the agents in real time.

Also each game contains a "play" folder. By executing the codes in these folders, you can see the performances of some of the successfully trained agents using the methods outlined in the paper, with some nice visualizations.

The data folder contains the arrays which were used to generate the graphs in the report.
